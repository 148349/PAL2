![](https://i.imgur.com/yejvggx.png "")


PAL2 is PAL but completely rewritten from the ground up in Kotlin, it also no longer requires you to install the java runtime for it to be used.

It's to be used to eliminate manual tracking of programs and their updates, and also launches all your addons prior to launching Path of Exile!

Stay up to date with all your favourite addons!
